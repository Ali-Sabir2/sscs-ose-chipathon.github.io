## How to Participate
- Visit the [SSCS Chipathon GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sscs-ose/sscs-ose-chipathon.github.io) to learn more about design tool setup, as well as the design target and its suggested baseline specifications. 
- Join the “opensource-silicon” Slack space and subscribe to the [“ieee-sscs-dc-23”](https://join.slack.com/share/enQtNDc1MjgzMTc4NTYyMC03YTY5NjI0NGUxN2UyMjgzZmI5YTQyYTcxMzQxY2M4NjUyMTk3ODE3ZTgzNTY2ZmQ3M2Y0NjYyZDQ4NWZjYmQ5) channel. This is the Chipathon’s main communication channel. Feel free to post any questions here (about tool setup, circuit design, etc.).
- Optionally, join the Chipathon info session (see schedule below) to ask questions and learn more about the design goals and logistics.
Create a Jupyter notebook detailing the main ideas of your design. You can choose to address a single sub-block (e.g., a programmable gain amplifier for the oscilloscope) or a more complete solution (e.g., the complete waveform generator design). For an example on how to describe a design idea using Jupyter, please see this [temperature sensor notebook](https://github.com/idea-fasoc/OpenFASOC/blob/main/docs/source/notebooks/temp-sense-gen/temp_sense_genCollab.ipynb). 
**Note: It is not necessary to create a layout at the proposal stage**.
- Create a pull request for your proposal notebook submission by the deadline stated below. Refer to the “how to submit” instructions in the Chipathon repository for further details.
