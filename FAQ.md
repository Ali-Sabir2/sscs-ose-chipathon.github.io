# FAQ

Q: Do I need to be an IEEE SSCS member to participate? A: No, but you are encouraged to join and benefit from our broad range of resources. Please refer to this link.  

Q: May I re-use someone else’s open-source design? A: Yes! Please be sure to give credit to the original contributor.  

Q: Does my design need to be open-source? A: Yes. Your design must be posted on a git-compatible repo and be publicly accessible. The project top-level must include a license file for an approved open-source license agreement (we recommend using the Apache-2.0 license). Third-party source code must be identified, and source code must contain proper headers. Refer to the Open MPW Shuttle Program FAQ for further guidance.   

Q: What is the purpose of the planned online meetups? A: We will use these meetings for project presentations, networking among teams, short lectures on various circuit design topics, tool support as well as any other topic that will help you learn and succeed!  

Q: What happens if I am selected, but cannot finish my design by the chipathon’s tapeout deadline? A: You can participate in a later Google-sponsored Open-MPW run.  

Q: Will I be able to allocate a full 10 mm2 Caravel seat for my tapeout? A: It is possible, but will depend on the size of your block. We will try to combine a number of blocks to maximize chip area utilization and to create useful subsystems (for example, ADC combined with a reference generator). We will use the meetups to plan possible design mergers.  

Q: Will all selected teams be able to tape out? A: We will perform design status audits before the tapeout and may only advance a subset of the designs based on their readiness.  

Q: I am not a participating designer, but would like to contribute as a volunteer/mentor, is this possible? A: Yes! Please sign up here.
